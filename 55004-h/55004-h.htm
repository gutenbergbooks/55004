<p class='c006'>We conclude, the public feel slightly interested
in our libel case; therefore we shall take
the liberty to lay before our readers a few extracts
from the weekly press of our city, as we
did in our last the opinions of the dailies.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>[<i>From the N. Y. Weekly Despatch.</i>]</h3>

<p class='c008'>During the last three months Branch’s <cite>Alligator</cite>
has been the talk of the town. Through
the columns of his little sheet, Branch has made
charges of the most serious nature against prominent
citizens and office holders. At first no
notice was taken of these attacks, finally, however,
these charges were so generally talked of
that it became necessary for the parties assailed
to notice them. Mayor Tiemann, Simeon Draper
and Supervisor Bell united in a complaint before
the Grand Jury, who found an indictment;
whereupon all the rest of the individuals who
had been honored with the attentions of the <cite>Alligator</cite>
set to work to aid in bringing Branch to
justice. His case was set down for trial in the
sessions on Monday last. When the case was
called, Branch announced himself ready for
trial; the District Attorney, however, said he
would not be ready till Tuesday. An attempt
had been made on Saturday to prejudice the
case by one of his bondsmen, being indused
to surrender Branch, and on Tuesday, in
the middle of the trial, Mr. Southworth,
the other bondsman, went into Court and surrendered
him. In both cases other parties
came forward and took the places of these
pretended friends. By applying the sharpest
rules of legal practice, his testimony was ruled
out and Branch was convicted, and without
giving him time to breathe, he was sentenced
to pay a fine of $250 and to be imprisoned in
the Penitentiary for one year. The Recorder
in his remarks volunteered the gentle hint to
the rest of the newspapers, that there were a
number of other editors whom he meant to
put through a similar course of sprouts. While
we do not care to quarrel with the verdict
of the jury, and certainly do not wish to
be understood as advocating the license of the
Press to assail unjustly the character of any
individual in the community, we must say to
the Recorder and the parties to the trial, that
we hardly think they will find any other case
in which they will be permitted to put an editor
through with quite such railroad speed,
though we admit that if justice were as
promptly administered in all cases, the Court
of Sessions would stand much higher in public
estimation. Of the real merits of Branch’s
case we have no means of judging. That he
believed the truth of the charges he made we
have not the slightest doubt. If there was
any falsehood in the matter, he was the dupe
of it and not the perpetrator, and we sincerely
regret that the prosecutors saw fit to avail
themselves of legal technicalities to shut out
what his witnesses had to say. It is quite as
unfortunate for them as it is for Branch.
While their suppression consigns him to prison
it leaves the prosecution open to invidious
comments, all of which might have been silenced
by dragging the slanderers (if such they
are) into the light of day and refuting these
calumnies. That, however, is their business,
not ours. In the meantime poor Branch has
been consigned to the tender mercies of the
Ten Governors—one of whom, at least, has
publicly announced his determination to “put
him through the <em>roughest course of training</em>
any man ever got on the Island.” We were
surprised to hear that the Governor in question
had made this <em>heartless</em> speech. We supposed
him to be a <em>Christian</em> and a <em>man</em>, but
we cannot reconcile the idea of striking a
fallen and powerless brother as either an evidence
of <em>Christianity or manhood</em>, and we
trust the Governor will yet see the impropriety
of attempting to put his threat into execution.
We see by this morning’s <cite>Express</cite>, that
Branch was on Friday seen in the quarry with
his hands all a mass of blisters, working away
under a broiling sun. This looks as though
the Governors intend to give him the full benefit
of his sentence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <cite>Herald</cite> takes the occasion of Branch’s
conviction to read us a lecture on the enormity
of scurrility and libel. No other print in
the country is so well qualified for the task.
Bennett evidently thinks New Yorkers have
short memories, not to recollect the obscene
and licentious character of the <cite>Herald</cite> in its
earlier days. He has used Branch as often as
any other paper in New York to abuse people
towards whom he had incurred a hostility,
but now he is down, Bennett kicks him with
the rest. We perceive that George Wilkes
has commenced a libel suit against Bennett for
what he said of <cite>Porter’s Spirit</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>[We have taken the liberty of <i>italicizing</i> a
portion of the above article—<i>Ed. Alligator.</i>]</p>

<h3 class='c007'>[<i>From the Sunday Times.</i>]</h3>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Libel Case Characteristics.</span>—The conviction
of Stephen H. Branch, before Recorder
Barnard, on Wednesday, of a libel on Mayor
Tiemann and two other public officers, naturally
created a sensation. So did the remarks
of the bench. Sentencing Mr. Branch to a
year’s imprisonment in the penitentiary and a
fine of two hundred and fifty dollars, while such
a man as Peter Dawson is subjected to incarceration
for only sixty days, is not likely, however,
to exert a wholesome effect upon the
public mind. We have no doubt the recorder
meant, by his severity, to make an example of
Branch, in order to deter other indiscreet men
who are more led by their impulses than their
judgment from indulging in similarly reprehensible
publications: but we conceive that justice
administered with such rigidity, under the
peculiar circumstances of the case, might seem
to wear the aspect of persecution; and converting
Branch into a martyr, neither elevates the
character of the court, nor wins the moral
sympathy of public opinion. The general mind
has really appropriated the idea that because
Branch attacked so important a person as Mayor
Tiemann, the whole power of the corporation
has been consolidated into one grand vindictive
effort to crush out the courageous but
silly slanderer. Every one naturally murmurs,
therefore, if this be so, who may not be the
next sacrifice? Common rumor does not hesitate
to insinuate that the character of the proceedings
taken against Branch, and the peremptory
treatment bestowed upon the counsel
for the prisoner, were the result of a preconcerted
arrangement of the authorities. This
assumption believed, who feels secure of justice
should he be unfortunate enough to incur the
enmity of a coalition so potential?</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Branch’s libels were coarse, scandalous,
and boldly reiterated. It was difficult to believe
them wholly foundationless, because an
investigation was demanded with such persistent
audacity. Branch openly avowed his readiness
to establish all his statements, however
defamatory; and although they criminated citizens
whose good name we had always been
taught to esteem, they started our incredulity,
and set every thinking mind astir with painful
distrust. We were glad, therefore, to find a
legitimate course adopted, and an appeal to the
laws made to decide the truth or falsity of the
accusations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Branch, as a libeller of the most extravagant
kind, merited condign punishment; but,
after all, it is very clear that Mr. Branch’s
strange, wild, energetic, incoherent nature, has
been made use of by somebody else to accomplish
his own purposes. Branch has been the
catspaw of some deeper and more sanely plotting
intellect behind the curtain; and we regret
that the Recorder considered it necessary
to rule out the testimony which might have
introduced us to the principals in this offensive
operation, instead of their harum-scarum instrument.
It would have been, as far as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>libelled ones are concerned, much better to
have probed the whole affair to the bottom,
even if the exact rule of evidence had been
made to yield temporarily to the exigency. It
would have been better for them to let the public
perceive precisely on what ground all this
edifice of mendacity had been constructed. It
would have exhibited the confidence which
belongs to conscious innocence. It would not
only have exposed the real wire-workers of this
game of wholesale calumniation, but, in demonstrating
the integrity of the parties assailed,
it would have left no unexplained mystery, no
dubious point of fact, around which malice
might still gather the shadowy wind-breath of
current scandal. If, however, they are satisfied,
we ought to be. We are not convinced
that Randall’s Island is a paradise of official
morality, and the great public would not credit
us were we to hazard an assertion to that effect;
but we <em>are</em> satisfied that the particular charges
made by Mr. Branch are untrue, though imposed
upon him as truths, and we hope that, having
had their probity completely substantiated
in the premises, the gentlemen so recklessly
accused by Mr. Branch are not disposed to be
vindictive.</p>

<p class='c009'>In conclusion, we must be permitted to say
that we do not admire the tone of the Recorder’s
remarks on passing sentence. It is the
first time we have had occasion to allude to
this gentleman except in terms of merited
commendation. We entertain a high opinion
of his general impartiality. His promptitude,
his disdain for pettifogger’s quibbling, his nice
sense of justice, and his freedom from those
tainted associations which rob the bench in
some quarters of dignity and public confidence,
have all contributed to place him in the
front rank of our criminal magistracy. We do
not impugn his integrity, therefore, but the
quality of his judgment both in imposing so
severe a sentence upon this weak and foolish
victim of designing knaves, and in speaking of
“other libellers,” to all of whom he contemplates
meting out a “similar punishment.”
We know very well that he intended to threaten
no respectable press, or to hint at fetters <i>in
terrorem</i> upon its proper independence—but
his language may be easily misinterpreted;
and when we consider how liable the most
prudent journalist is to daily imposition, the
observation that “this verdict settles the fact
that no man can make an assertion in a newspaper
without being liable to be punished
criminally, unless he can substantiate it,”
seems to us one of gratuitous harshness, and
in any body else would be called one of petulence
and ill-humor. Branch’s excitement,
however, had doubtless disturbed the usual
current of quiet feeling which characterizes
the conduct of the Recorder, and we see the
effect. The best of us are open to these influences,
and we are not inclined to forget how
much the community owes to the general honesty
and equity of Recorder Barnard, in our
exceptions to what is, perhaps, but a hasty expression
or so in the present instance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Considering that there are at least 10 or 12
suits for libel pending against the <cite>Herald</cite>, for
gross and malicious libels upon sundry respectable
citizens, it is really refreshing to peruse
its comments upon the warning given by Recorder
Barnard in the Branch case, to libellers
generally. What the <cite>Alligator</cite> <span class='fss'>IS</span>, the <cite>Herald</cite>
<span class='fss'>WAS</span>; and if the latter has improved in decency
in proportion as it has increased in responsibility,
necessity, not choice, lies at the bottom
of the metamorphosis. We are afraid that
the Recorder’s hint was purposed, in fact, for
the special edification of the <cite>Herald</cite>. And,
notwithstanding that journal’s sudden disposition
to saponize <em>both</em> the gentlemen on the
bench of the General Sessions, instead of its
customary one, the Recorder may chance to
give its responsible conductor a lesson of impartiality
he little expects by coercing him,
despite his self-importance, to keep company
with Mr. Branch, as a reward for some of
his virulent assaults on private character.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>[<i>From the N. Y. Sunday Mercury.</i>]</h3>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Branch’s Sentence.</span>—Quite unexpectedly
the trial of Stephen H. Branch, for libel against
Mayor Tiemann, Simeon Draper and Isaac Bell,
was brought up and dispatched, during the past
week, with a velocity which would make the
most wholesome impression, were the rest of the
District Attorney’s calendar put through with
equal promptness and exemplary effect. Branch
was found guilty, and sentenced to one year’s
imprisonment on Blackwell’s Island, and two
hundred and fifty dollars fine. The <cite>Tribune</cite>, in
alluding to this sentence of Branch by Recorder
Barnard, says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Considering that the libel, however
groundless essentially, appears to have had a
real foundation in statements made to Branch
by persons whom he undoubtedly believed,
and whom his counsel had ready to produce
(but their testimony was not allowed), we
must consider this sentence a severe one. We
believe it will excite for him a sympathy which
it is unwise to provoke. Branch, we believe,
has been trying pretty hard to libel <em>us</em> in his
abusive little sheet; but we have never considered
his slanders worth any sort of notice.
It may be well to stop his career, but not to
make him a martyr. And we say most decidedly,
that considering the libel for which he
was indicted was really based on information
furnished him by persons whom he had reason
to believe, we deem his sentence a harsh one,
and trust it may be mitigated by pardon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By the press generally, the matter is regarded
pretty much in the same temper, excepting
the anomalous instance of the <cite>Herald</cite>! That
immaculate sheet takes occasion to give utterance
to any extent of wrath and indignation
against Branch and his <cite>Alligator</cite>, and characteristically
against such of its cotemporaries,
present and past, as it would desire to
denounce and stigmatise, with an odor which
has by no means been washed from its own
bedraggled garments. Indeed, as the direct
object of the <cite>Herald</cite> would appear to be
a malicious fling at the <cite>Spirit of the Times</cite> in
view of another case on the Recorder’s docket—that
of Judge Russell’s indictment—so the
<cite>Herald</cite> lays itself liable to another indictment,
which has been duly entered against
Bennett for no less than twenty-five thousand
dollars.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <cite>Herald’s</cite> fulminations, and the political
pressure brought to bear upon Branch by his
prosecutors must inevitably have the effect of
exciting a warm public sympathy for their object.
Such, indeed, is the manner in which
the infliction of the full penalty of the statute
is regarded in this case, that the prosecutors
themselves will be forced to step in as petitioners
for a pardon, or incur no little odium in the
business. Besides, what is very sensibly remarked
by the <cite>Tribune</cite>, as to the foundation
of Branch’s charges, it might be added that
the public have no means of judging whether
those charges are well founded or not. By a
course of proceedings altogether extraordinary
on the part of the prosecution, the apparent
real evidence in the case was completely excluded,
and Branch convicted solely upon the
oaths of his prosecutors, without an actual investigation
of the presumed issue on which the
libel originated. The public are largely exercised
on the matter, and inquiry is particularly
active as to who the “Matron” really is?
Why she was not put upon the stand, and
what she could have to say for herself? How
would her previous character have justified
her taking the stand as a witness, or of holding
the position she has occupied under the
chief magistrate? These points are matters
of curious comment among the people, necessarily
provoked by the seemingly harsh and
rough-shod procedure in the case. It is to be
regretted the matter was not fully cleared up
by the production of the entire evidence.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>How Branch confronts his Fate.</span>—The
renowned tamer of alligators—I may as well
add, <i>en passant</i>—was duly surrendered to
Warden Finch on Thursday, having been escorted
hither to his prison by a little host of
friends, whose temper indicated no disposition
to desert him. Sympathy is strongly in his
favor, on the ground, of course, that, whatever
may be thought of his offence, his treatment
at the hands of the officials and lawyers,
has been such as only a weak and comparatively
friendless man like him would meet.
You will soon see his prosecutors forced to sue
for his deliverance, just as eagerly as they
have pressed for his imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides the sensation created here, it has
been noticeable that a general scattering—“on
leave”—of certain subordinates, has taken
place during the late “inquest.” It is doubtful
if Stephen will, even here, have a chance
to confront the mysterious “matron.” The
fright of the trial being apparently over, the
fugitives from the Alms-House will doubtless
return forthwith. Under the discipline of
these precincts they will find their best protection,
as well from the impertinence of cross-examining
lawyers, as from the no less stringent
inquiries of a keen public curiosity, mainly
aroused by the suppression of the inside
testimony which could be found here. The
nature and source of this I have already pointed
out. Should the motion in arrest of judgment
reopen the trial, it will doubtless be for
the admission of the main evidence in the
case, so mysteriously and adroitly evaded by
the prosecution. Then only can the provoking
rumors, now so general, be set at rest, or satisfactorily
determined.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fate of Branch here, it appears, will be
in no degree lenient, as there is more than one
petty tyrant under the vice royalty who seems
desirous of venting his spleen upon the unfortunate
man. He has taken his place, it appears,
already, by direction of the keepers, beside
the common fellows in the quarries. The directions
of one of the Governors is quoted to
the effect that he would be “put through the
roughest course of training any man ever got
on the Island.” I have purposely withheld a
variety of matters in connection with these
precincts this week, until the interests with
Stephen, with regard to the Ten Governors, is
more definitively settled.</p>

</div>

<div class='double'>

</div>

<p class='c006'>If there be one thing more than another on
which we had fully made up our minds it is
this: that our country is pre-eminently free—yea,
the freest in the whole family of nations.
But the history of the past week has taught us
how very easily it is to be mistaken.</p>

<p class='c009'>The trial of Stephen H. Branch in our Court
of Sessions, a few days ago, teaches us a lesson
which we ought not soon to forget. From the
time that our great nabob, Mayor Tiemann, associated
with the Peter Cooper <em>guild</em>, first made
their complaint, or “Trinity” of complaints,
down to the passing of the sentence in the
Court of Sessions, the trial was one of the most
vindictive and one-sided affair, on the part of
the prosecution, that we recollect during our
sojourn on this “miserable globe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first place, it was proved on the trial
that one of the complainants, or more properly
<em>persecutors</em>, had never been before the Grand
Jury. In the second place, it would appear
that indictments by the dozen must have been
preferred against the accused; for if we recollect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>aright, he was arrested every day for nearly
a fortnight, previous to his trial. And again we
have been told—how far it is true we care not
to inquire—that one man who professed great
friendship for him, and became his bail on the
last arrest, two days before his trial, on the following
day withdrew his bail, and delivered
the unfortunate man up to his adversaries; and
in consequence of this latter act realised a contract
from the city authorities. “Save us from
our friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If all this be true, it is one of the most arrant
pieces of villany ever recorded of Christian
men.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we come into court we, unfortunately,
if possible, find things worse. The ruling of
the Judge was altogether too strict—too severe—in
fact too arbitrary. The Judge, it appears
to us, made it a point of his business to shield,
as much as possible, the complainants on the
one hand, by interfering in behalf of the Mayor,
when he was being cross-questioned by
defendant’s Counsel; whilst on the other hand
he ruled out the principal evidence in support
of the defendant, and of course deprived the
accused of the slightest shadow of a chance to
establish his innocence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then comes the Recorder’s charge to the
Jury. And that we think is in keeping; or,
perhaps, we ought to say an improvement on
the spirit of the whole proceedings. Let any
one sit down and read that charge calmly and
dispassionately, and we venture to assert that
for severity the reader cannot find a case to surpass
it, nor perhaps even to equal it in the history
of modern English jurisprudence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, if we consider the hurried manner in
which the prosecution got up this trial, and
their mode of conducting it, as described above,
we must consider the proceedings unwarranted
by the premises; and forms a great contrast
to the tardy manner in which our Courts mete
out their infinitismal doses of punishment to
Thieves, Burglars, Murderers and Desperadoes.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is still another charge, which in our
opinion is the gravest of all. After the rendition
of the verdict the counsel for the defence
moved a stay of proceedings; now mark
the reply of his honor. <em>That he had yesterday
considered the possibility of such an application,
and had</em> <span class='fss'>THEN MADE UP HIS MIND</span>
<em>that it could not be granted</em>. So from this it
would appear, that the whole affair was settled
before the parties came into court; and so
far as the trial goes, it was simply a collateral
incident of the proceedings, and not at all an
operation for attaining the great end of justice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, we do not say a word as to the guilt
or innocence of Mr. Branch. He may be
guilty—he may be innocent; we are just as
far, if not farther, from that point than we were
a month ago; and this is the ground of our
complaint.</p>

<p class='c009'>If such proceedings be allowed permanently
to obtain in our courts of justice, then we say
that “trial by jury becomes a mockery, a delusion,
and a snare.”</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Board of Aldermen</span>, }</div>
<div class='c012'>February 6, 1854. }</div>

<p class='c009'>The following petition of Peter Cooper, in
relation to the prevention and extinguishing of
fire, and to give greater efficiency to the Police
Department, was received and laid on the table
and ordered to be printed.</p>

<div class='c013'><span class='sc'>D. T. Valentine</span>,</div>
<div class='c012'>Clerk.</div>

<p class='c009'>To the Hon. the Mayor and Common Council
of the city of New York.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>[<span class='sc'>Concluded.</span>]</h3>

<p class='c008'>It must be apparent to every reflecting mind
that the great extent of our city already, imposes
a burden on the present firemen so great,
that we have no right to expect that it will be
borne a great while longer by a voluntary Fire
Department.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is evident that something should be done at
once to furnish the Fire Department, the relief
that they have a right to expect from the excessive
labor that is unavoidable in drawing
their engines to and from, and the hazzard and
fatigue of working them at the numerous fires
that take place.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the opinion of your subscriber, the plan of
placing light carts with hose at convenient
distances in every street, to be at the service
of a body of police, all interested to use this
hose for the extinguishment of fires with the
greatest possible energy and effect, is the best
that can be adopted. By this arrangement it
is safe to calculate that the present Fire Department
will be relieved from something like
three quarters of the duties they are now called
upon to perform. As an equivalent for this
relief, I propose that the Fire Department shall
become the guard of honor for our city, to be
called out as firemen or soldiers whenever
their services are required by the proper authorities
of our city. This arrangement proposes
to continue the present Fire Department
with every privilege they now enjoy, and relieve
them from more than half the labors
they are now required to perform.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is believed by your subscriber, that the
plan proposed will make the Fire Department
and also the present active Police Department,
the most useful and honorable bodies of men
in our city. The hearty co-operation of the
members of the Fire Department, and also the
members of the Police to secure for our city
the blessings which must naturally result from
this arrangement, will entitle them not only to
the pecuniary advantages that must result to
themselves and their families, but to the lasting
gratitude and respect of every worthy inhabitant
of our city.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is worthy of remark that the insurance
companies of this city have now in their employ
eighty (80) men, at an expense of thirty (30)
thousand dollars a year, to watch against fires.
I am informed that they intend greatly to increase
this force; in addition, your subscriber,
with a great number of merchants and private
families, have for years constantly employed
private watchmen, to guard our stores and
watch our dwellings from robbery and fires.
All that these cost, and more, would be gladly
contributed to a body of police who would, by
a faithful performance of duty, secure the
necessary relief for our Fire department, by
lessening annually the number of fires, and
also by reducing the amount of property stolen
below the average agreed upon.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have taken the liberty to invite the attention
of your honorable body to an <span class='fss'>ARRANGEMENT
AND PRINCIPLE</span> by which a large majority
of all the officers in the employ of the city
will become pecuniarily and otherwise interested
in a faithful performance of their
duty. Such performance will not only secure
to them the large fund provided by the Corporation,
and in addition the fund to be recovered
from the insurance companies, as a reward
for reducing the loss by fire below the average
agreed upon, but they would, in addition, find
the faithful performance of duty the surest
relief from excessive labor, by diminishing the
number of fires and the amount of crime that
now form so great and so unpleasant a part of
their present labor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The principal idea in the foregoing communication,
was presented by your subscriber to
a previous Common Council, some twelve
years since, under a full sense of the great advantages
that would result by saving millions
of property annually from destruction, and
what is of more value, it would save the health
and morals of thousands of the best and most
enthusiastic young men of our city from being
broken down and destroyed by their loss of
time and the excessive labor occasioned by the
numerous fires that take place, and which
would mainly be prevented by adopting the
arrangement proposed.</p>

<div class='c014'>All of which is most respectfully submitted.</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  <h2 id='leslie' class='c005'>FRANK LESLIE AGAIN ARRESTED.<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>RICH SCENE AT THE TOMBS!</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>[<i>From the Sunday Times.</i>]</h3>

<p class='c015'>Frank Leslie was again arrested yesterday morning, on complaint
of Aldermen Reed and Tuomy. The officer told Mr. Leslie
that his orders were imperative to take him at once before Justice
Osborne at the Tombs, without allowing him to send for counsel
or seek for bail. On arriving at the Tombs, they were met by Aldermen
Tuomy and Reed, accompanied by Mr. John Graham,
their counsel. Justice Osborne asked Mr. Leslie if he demanded
an examination. Mr. Leslie stated that he had not been allowed
time to send for his counsel, and did not know what course to pursue.
Justice Osborne said he could have time to send for counsel
and for bail.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Graham then produced the complaints. That of Alderman
Reed set forth that Mr. Leslie had published a picture representing
him in the garb of a butcher, with a party of Irishmen driving
a miserable and diseased-looking cow, without tail or horns, up to
his stall. The leader of the party, Mr. Mike O’Flannagan, is represented
as saying: “I read you tould the aldermen t’other day
that swill-fed beef was worth half a cent a pound more than any
other kind of meat. Here’s a beauty, yer honor; doesn’t he look
fat and luscious? Arrah! don’t yer eyes wather to look at it?—Here’s
the baste; we’ve brought it on purpose fer yez. Hand us
over the dimes!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Alderman Reed is represented as saying:—“I don’t deal in that
kind of beef. I stated that as an alderman, not as a butcher.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Ald. Tuomy makes two complaints against Mr. Leslie. In the
first one Ald. Tuomy is represented as a ranting, roaring Irishman
on board the Ericsson, with a bottle of whisky in one hand and a
shillelah in the other, saying—“If I catch the “Tribune” reporter
I’ll throw him overboard, G—d d—n him.” The second one embraces
an alleged libellous article, and a caricature of Aldermen
Tuomy and Reed, in which their nasal peculiarities are most outrageously
magnified. Mr. Graham stated to the court that he
desired to compel Leslie to give $2,500 bail in each case; in the two
former instances, to keep the peace for twelve months, and abstain
from publishing any more caricatures; and in the third case
to answer criminally to the Sessions. Mr. Graham proceeded to
say, that they intended to show these English scoundrels that
they could not libel and caricature respectable citizens with impunity.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Leslie said—“You had better keep cool, Mr. Graham.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Graham, who was evidently very much excited, jumped up
and said—“Don’t speak to me, you scoundrel, or I shall not be
answerable for the consequences. I ask your Honor to note that
this is an attempt to intimidate respectable counsel. These fellows
intend to caricature the whole court. I’ll neck the first man I see
take out a pencil. [At this juncture our reporter took out his
pencil and began to take notes.] The first acquaintance I ever
had with him showed him (pointing to Leslie) to be a d—d
scoundrel. If they will meet me on any flat in New York (pointing
to Leslie and his friend Watson), I’ll take the heads off both
of them. I’ll show them by the swelling of their chops there’s
no Miss Nancyism about me” [shaking his fist in their faces].</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Leslie</span>—“We are gentlemen—we are no pugilists, Mr.
Graham.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Mr. Graham.—“You are a G—d d—d English thief. I can lick
the pair of you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Judge Osborne.—“Mr. Graham, you must stop this, as I can’t
allow it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Graham.—“Within the past seventy-two hours he has sent a
shaft to the heart of the only remaining parent I have on earth,
and the other night I went down alone past his establishment, intending
if I met him on the curb to whip him like a dog.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Leslie asked if the court intended to allow such procedings
to continue. They were gentlemen, and not blackguards.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ald. Reed.—“If they are gentlemen, one has sailed under an alias
for the past five years.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Leslie.—“That is not true.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Justice Osborne.—“Gentlemen, you must stop this.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Graham.—“The only question is, are two gentlemen to be
constantly libelled by these English transports? They contaminate
the air. If I stay in the room with them much longer, I shall
suffocate. [Pointing to them.]. See what mean-looking English
thieves they are!”</p>

<p class='c016'>At this juncture, a gentleman, who we believe is Mr. Leslie’s
printer, got up and told Mr. Graham that he must not speak to
him in that way. This style of conversation continued some time
longer, but did not lead to any breach of the peace, although it
was evident that Mr. Graham needed but a very small provocation
to make him take off his coat and “go in.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Leslie gave the required bail to keep the peace, justifying
himself, in $5,000, and two sureties of $2,500 each. Messrs. Sam
S. Sherwood and Alexander Douglass became his bail.</p>

<p class='c028'>AN ACT to submit the question of calling a Convention to revise
the Constitution and amend the same, to the People of the
State:</p>

<p class='c026'>Passed April 17, 1858—three-fifths being present.</p>

<p class='c028'><i>The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate
and Assembly, do enact as follows</i>:</p>

<p class='c026'><span class='sc'>Section 1.</span> The Inspectors of Election in each town, ward, and
election district in this State, at the annual election to be held in
November next, shall provide a proper box to receive the ballots
of the citizens of this State entitled to vote for members of the
Legislature at such election. On such ballot shall be written or
printed, or partly written and printed, by those voters who are in
favor of a Convention, the words: “Shall there be a Convention
to Revise the Constitution and amend the same? Yes.” And by
those voters who are opposed thereto, the words: “Shall there be
a Convention to Revise the Constitution and amend the same?
No.” And all citizens entitled to vote as aforesaid shall be allowed
to vote by ballot as aforesaid, in the election district in which
he resides, and not elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c026'>§2. So much of the articles one, two and three, of title four, of
chapter one hundred and thirty, of an act entitled “An act respecting
elections other than for militia and town officer,” passed
April fifth, eighteen hundred and forty-two, and the acts amending
the same, as regulates the manner of conducting elections and
challenges, oaths to be administered, and inquiries to be made, of
persons offering to vote, shall be deemed applicable to the votes to
be given or offered under the act: and the manner of voting and
challenges, and the penalties for false swearing, prescribed by law,
are hereby declared in full force and effect in voting or offering to
vote under this act.</p>

<p class='c026'>§3. The said votes given for and against a convention, in pursuance
of this act, shall be canvassed by the Inspectors of the several
election districts or polls of the said election in the manner prescribed
by law, and as provided in article four, of title four, of
chapter one hundred and thirty of the said act, passed April fifth,
eighteen hundred and forty-two, and the acts amending the same,
as far as the same are applicable; and such canvass shall be completed
by ascertaining the whole number of votes given in each
election district or poll for a convention, and the whole number of
votes given against such convention, in the form aforesaid; and
the result being found, the inspectors shall make a statement in
words, at full length, of the number of ballots received in relation
to such convention, and shall also state in words, at full length,
the whole number of ballots having thereon the words, “Shall
there be a Convention to revise the Constitution and amend the
same? No.” Such statements as aforesaid shall contain a caption,
stating the day on which, and the number of the district, the
town or ward, and the county at which the election was held, and
at the end thereof a certificate that such statement is correct in all
respects, which certificate shall be subscribed by all the inspectors,
and a true copy of such statement shall be immediately filed by
them in the office of the clerk of the town or city.</p>

<p class='c026'>§4. The original statements, duly certified as aforesaid, shall be
delivered by the inspectors, or one of them to be deputed for that
purpose, to the supervisor, or, in case there be no supervisor, or
he shall be disabled from attending the board of canvassers, then
to one of the assessors of the town or ward, within twenty-four
hours after the same shall have been subscribed by such inspectors,
to be disposed of as other statements at such election, are
now required by law.</p>

<p class='c026'>§5. So much of articles first, second, third, and fourth, of title
fifth, of chapter one hundred and thirty, of the act entitled, “An
act respecting elections other than for militia and town officers,”
and the acts amending the same, as regulates the duties of County
Canvassers and their proceedings, and the duty of County
Clerks, and the Secretary of State, and the Board of State Canvassers,
shall be applied to the canvassing and ascertaining the
will of the people of this State in relation to the proposed convention;
and if it shall appear that a majority of the votes or
ballots given in and returned as aforesaid are against a convention,
then the said canvassers are required to certify and declare
that fact by a certificate, subscribed by them; and filed with the
Secretary of State: but if it shall appear by the said canvass that
a majority of the ballots or votes given as aforesaid are for a convention,
then they shall by like certificates, to be filed as aforesaid,
declare that fact; and the said Secretary shall communicate
a copy of such certificate to both branches of the Legislature,
at the opening of the next session thereof.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
